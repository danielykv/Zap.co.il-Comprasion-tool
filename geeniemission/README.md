Hello, this is my solution to the assignment.\
I used ExpressJS (based on NodeJS) to run my back-end server,\
i used Puppeteer.js to gather and scrape the relevant data to complete the assignment, \
And i also used ReactJS to make the required web app. \
Hope you like my work!


## My work planning

Before I started the part of writing the code, I spent time planning the task and thinking about what was required of me to do, so that I could perform the task as efficiently and quickly as possible.\
Before every project I start, I dedicate time to sketching and planning the system, something that keeps me focused on the task and gives me a kind of "compass" that guides me to create the desired product

## Installation

In the project directory, after opening a terminal, you need to do firstly:
```bash
  npm install
```

After that, you can run the react app and the server.

Open the terminal and input this command:
```bash
  npm start
```

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser. (should opened automaticlly)

That's it! Enjoy and Thank you!
